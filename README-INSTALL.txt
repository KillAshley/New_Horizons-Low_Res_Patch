----INSTALLATION----

Simply merge the downloaded .zip files into your KSP directory the same as with any other mod.
Overwriting all files when prompted.
Then navigate to GameData/New_Horizons/Cache and delete all the .bin files

DO NOT EXTRACT THE .zip FILE STRAIGHT OUT - open it and merge the contents.
This should be all you are required to do for a basic install.
